# Pixabay plugin for Craft CMS by Webburo spring

This plugin adds a "Search Pixabay" button to all asset selection windows. The selected pictures will be automatically downloaded from Pixabay and saved to the server.

You need to have a Pixabay account and a Pixabay API key, which can be found at https://pixabay.com/api/docs/. If you want the original size images to be downloaded, you need to be approved for full API access. This plugin follows Pixabay's terms and conditions for full API access.
